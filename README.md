This is a remake of my first web project ever made, which was the first project for Acamica's frontend bootcamp.

Since I was entirely new to web dev, the project I did back then (around 2 years ago) was very messy, and not very organised.

And while in this remake, I did everything again, I did follow the same prototype, and stick to the technologies I was supposed to use (Plain HTML and CSS).
