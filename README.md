This is a remake of my first webpage ever made; The first project for Acamica's frontend bootcamp.

Since I was entirely new to webdev, the project I did back then (around 2 years ago) was very messy, so I decided to give it another try.

While this version was made from scratch, I did follow the same prototype as the first version, and stuck to the technologies I was supposed to use back then (plain HTML and CSS).
